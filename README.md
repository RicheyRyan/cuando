## Motivation

JavaScript has poor support for conditional expressions, and handling scenarios with more than three clauses is impossible. It's awkward when handling conditions in JSX which encourages an expression oriented approach and doesn't provide conditional elements found in a templating language like Handlebars.

Some proposals would bring more powerful conditional expressions to JavaScript like [do](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-do-expressions) and [pattern matching](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching), but they are a long way off and may never happen. In an ideal world, this library would be made redundant by these proposals making it into the language.

Here's an example that handles the status of an API call using the `Match` function:

```ts
function Example() {
  const { status, error, data } = useQuery("repoData", () =>
    fetch("https://api.github.com/repos/richeyryan/quando").then(res =>
      res.json(),
    ),
  );

  return (
    <div>
      {Match(status)
        .where("error", () => <>"An error has occured: " {error.message}</>)
        .where("loading", "Loading...")
        .end(() => (
          <>
            <h1>{data.name}</h1>
            <p>{data.description}</p>
            <strong>üëÄ {data.subscribers_count}</strong>{" "}
            <strong>‚ú® {data.stargazers_count}</strong>{" "}
            <strong>üç¥ {data.forks_count}</strong>
          </>
        ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functions

_Compatibility_

The API aims to avoid clashing with current or potential future JavaScript features. We avoid reserved words where possible, and `When` is capitalized to avoid conflicts with the pattern matching proposal.

_[Fluent Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)_

Each function has a chainable API or fluent interface. You must complete the chain with the `end` method, which will return the result of your expression. You can also provide the default value with the end method if there are no matches in your condition.

_Lazy Evaluation_

The result parameter of any condition can be a function. The function will be called if the condition passes. This prevents issues like in the example above where we get an error if we try to read `data.name` before it's defined.

### When

The equivalent of an if statement.

```js
import { When } from "quando";

When(status === "loading", <Loading />)
  .elseWhen(status === "error", <Error message="Failed to load user" />)
  .elseWhen(status === "success", <User user={user} />)
  .end();
```

### Unless

The equivalent of an early return or something like `!user &&`

```js
import { Unless } from "quando";

Unless(user, "Select a user to continue");
```

### Match

A very rough approximation of pattern matching. Basically an expression version of a switch statement.

```js
Match("John")
  .where("John", "guitar")
  .where("George", "guitar")
  .where("Paul", "bass")
  .where("Ringo", "drums")
  .end();
```
